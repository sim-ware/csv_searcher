# csv_searcher

# Pandas // DataFraming
-seemed like the most nimble way to handle a csv in memory
-experience using it before and it has a large vocabulary of in-built functions
  that make handling csv files much simpler for me.

# Fuzzy Matching
-wanted to do subsetting of strings
-didn't allow for fuzz / slight differences in strings that aren't easily
  detectable through code.
-experience using FuzzyMatching packages in past, which allow us to parameterise
  their strictness, seemed ready-made for this challenge.

# MVP
-read the csv to a dataframeYUP
-create a separate .txt file with the example queries
-read the .txt file and store the query strings as an appropriate form. List of
  Lists?
